Problem:
You are given a 0-indexed 2D integer matrix grid of size n * n with values in the range [1, n2]. Each integer appears exactly once except a which appears twice and b which is missing. The task is to find the repeating and missing numbers a and b.

Return a 0-indexed integer array ans of size 2 where ans[0] equals to a and ans[1] equals to b.
Solution:
- We create two sets:
    1. `all_numbers`: A set containing all expected numbers from 1 to nÂ².
    2. `values`: A set to track numbers encountered in the grid.
- As we iterate through `grid`, we:
    - Check if a number is **already in `values`** (meaning it's duplicated).
    - Add each number to `values`.
- The missing number is found using `all_numbers - values`.
- Finally, we return `[duplicate, missing]`.
