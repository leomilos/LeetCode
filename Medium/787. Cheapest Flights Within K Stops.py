Problem  
Given `n` cities connected by flights represented as `flights[i] = [from, to, price]`,  
find the **cheapest price** from `src` to `dst` with at most `k` stops.  
If no such route exists, return `-1`.  

Solution  
This solution uses a **modified Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm** with an additional constraint  
on the number of stops.  
- A graph is represented using an adjacency list.  
- A priority queue (min-heap) is used to always process the cheapest path first.  
- A `price` dictionary tracks the minimum cost to reach each city  
  with a given number of stops.  
- The algorithm runs a **BFS-like traversal** using the heap,  
  expanding paths only if they do not exceed `k` stops.  
- The minimum cost to reach the destination is extracted from the tracking table.  

This approach runs in **O(E log N)** time complexity,  
where `E` is the number of flights and `N` is the number of cities,  
ensuring an efficient solution for the **cheapest flight with at most K stops** problem.
