Problem  
Given two words `word1` and `word2`, return the **minimum number of operations**  
required to convert `word1` into `word2`.  
Allowed operations:  
- **Insertion** of a character  
- **Deletion** of a character  
- **Replacement** of a character

Solution 
- build a word Cache (matrix) where len is word1 +1 and word2 +1
- the plus 1 is to put the base cases that mean if i had to replace all letters how many i will spend
- than with the base case i get start calculate the rest of the cases getting the opperation needed 
- add got the right side, remove get the bottom element, equal get the diagonal (down/right)
- repeat thist till get to 0 0 and return it

This approach runs in **O(M Ã— N)** time complexity
