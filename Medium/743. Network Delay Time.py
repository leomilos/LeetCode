Problem  
Given a list of directed edges `times` where `times[i] = [u, v, w]` represents a signal  
traveling from node `u` to node `v` in `w` time, determine how long it will take for  
all nodes to receive the signal starting from node `k`.  
If some nodes are unreachable, return `-1`.  

Solution  
This solution implements **Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm** using a **min-heap (priority queue)**  
to find the shortest path from the starting node `k` to all other nodes.  
- The graph is represented as an adjacency list with weighted edges.  
- A priority queue is used to process nodes with the shortest known distance first.  
- The algorithm updates the minimum distance to each node and continues processing  
  until all reachable nodes have been visited.  
- The maximum distance among all reachable nodes is returned as the answer.  
- If any node remains at infinite distance, it means it is unreachable, so `-1` is returned.  

This approach runs in **O(E log N)** time complexity, where `E` is the number of edges  
and `N` is the number of nodes, making it optimal for sparse graphs.
